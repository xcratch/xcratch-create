Use npm version command to update the version number. This will automatically:

2. Run the build script
3. Create version-specific build files in `dist/{version}/`
4. Update `dist/versions.json` with the new version info
5. Create a git commit and tag

```sh
# Patch version (1.3.0 ‚Üí 1.3.1)
npm version patch

# Minor version (1.3.1 ‚Üí 1.4.0)
npm version minor

# Major version (1.4.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
npm version major
```

#### Deploy to GitHub Pages

After creating a new version, push the tag to trigger automatic deployment:

```sh
# Push the version tag
git push origin v1.4.0

# Or push all tags
git push --tags
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Build the extension
2. Deploy `dist/`, `projects/`, and `README.md` to GitHub Pages

You can also manually trigger deployment from the Actions tab in GitHub.
